"""A2A AgentExecutor backed by ``claude -p`` (a2a-sdk 1.x / protobuf types).

Generic Bridge-Agent executor: RequestContext → claude -p subprocess → EventQueue.
Instance-specific copy (the user-facing status strings) is injected via
``messages`` so the CORE runtime ships English and an instance can localise.

A2A-correctness, beyond the happy path:
- The final answer is delivered as a durable Task **artifact** AND kept in the
  completed status message (so a status.message-reading widget needs no change).
- ``cancel`` actually aborts the in-flight ``claude -p`` run (cancels the asyncio
  task, whose ``finally`` kills the subprocess) and emits CANCELLED.
- Per-conversation memory is an LRU bounded in BOTH dimensions (turns per context
  AND number of contexts), so a public stream of unique sessionIds can't leak it.
