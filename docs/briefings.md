# Briefing profiles

Every person who uses a Bridge wants a different morning. One works from
GitHub issues, one from a Jira project, one from a customer's Azure board and
a calendar. A **briefing profile** says which, in a file the person owns:

```
workflow/briefings/morning.yaml     # plain /briefing
workflow/briefings/acme.yaml        # /briefing acme, before the customer call
workflow/briefings/weekly.yaml      # /briefing weekly, Friday afternoon
```

`scripts/briefing.py` runs the profile: every section with its own time limit,
side by side (each is its own program or service), the result in the order
written. The agent then advises on and renders what came back
(`skills/briefing/references/control.md`). Collection is code, not prose an
agent re-reads each morning, because a prose step can be skipped and nobody
notices: on one observed morning the trackers were not queried at all.

## Commands

```bash
python3 scripts/briefing.py list                  # the profiles, the default, their offer_on phrases
python3 scripts/briefing.py show [<id>]           # the resolved profile (also the built-in one)
python3 scripts/briefing.py offer "<text>"        # profiles whose offer_on matches the text
python3 scripts/briefing.py collect [<id>] --json --file
python3 scripts/briefing.py render [<id>] --file  # the morning run: collect, file, bookkeeping, view
python3 scripts/briefing.py render [<id>]         # collect + terminal text in the profile's view
python3 scripts/briefing.py render --style plan   # another view for this one run
python3 scripts/briefing.py collect --skip tracker --skip calendar   # the quick mode
python3 scripts/briefing.py collect --only tracker --only calendar   # only these kinds, the rest listed as skipped
python3 scripts/briefing.py collect --json --max-items 500   # every row, for a dashboard that pages itself
python3 scripts/briefing.py collect --fresh       # ask every source now, whatever cache_minutes allows
python3 scripts/briefing.py owed [<id>]           # streams the profile does not cover, and how to run them
python3 scripts/briefing.py validate              # every profile; exit 1 on a problem
```

## Which profile runs

1. The id given (`/briefing acme`).
2. bridge-config.yaml `briefing.default`: the person's own choice, which wins
   over a flag in a file that may come from a shared overlay.
3. The profile with `default: true` (at most one; `validate` refuses two).
4. The only profile, when there is one.
5. Several and none chosen: `collect` exits 2 and names them; the agent asks.
6. No profile at all: the **built-in** one, equal to the briefing before
   profiles existed (inbox, advise, tasks, the trackers enabled under
   `integrations.*`, calendar when a tool is installed, activity, and the
   day's tabs when a `workplace:` block is configured). Existing Bridges keep
   working without a file.

`offer_on` lists phrases on which the Bridge proposes a profile by name
("good morning" → morning, "acme" → acme). That is how a Bridge with several
profiles offers the right one instead of the person having to remember ids.

## Section kinds

| kind | Shows | Keys |
|---|---|---|
| `inbox` | open inbox items, most urgent first ([inbox](inbox.md)) | `max` |
| `advise` | the advice checks: collisions, quiet and blocked tasks, WIP | `max` |
| `workplace` | the day's tab plan: one tab per task, grouped into workspaces, opened on your yes through the configured driver (cmux ships as `skills/cmux`) ([workplace](workplace.md)) | `max` |
| `tasks` | `work/tasks/*/STATUS.md` | `status` (default doing, review), `contexts`, `max` |
| `activity` | `work/log.md` rows of the last days | `days` (default 7), `max` |
| `commits` | commits per repository per day as a sparkline (`▁▃█▂`), busiest first, by local committer date (the date `--since` filters on, so a rebase or another time zone lands on the right day). Repositories without commits in the window are left out; one that cannot be read is named under housekeeping; reaching the time limit fails the section instead of hiding repositories | `days` (1 or more, default 7), `repos` (registered names or paths; default: every clone the ecosystem files register, plus this Bridge; a clone is `local_path`, else `local_root` + the repository name from `github:`, and a file without `local_root` uses the one in `ecosystem.yaml`; `${var}` from bridge-config `identity:`), `author` (`me` = each repository's git user.email), `all_branches` (every local branch) |
| `calendar` | events in local time; also handed to `advise` for collisions. `ics` converts UTC and `TZID` times but lists a recurring event (RRULE) on its first date only: use `icalbuddy` or a `command` for recurring calendars | `provider` (auto, icalbuddy, ics, command), `days`, `path` (ics), `argv` (command), `exclude_calendars` (icalbuddy), `info_calendars` (calendar names whose events are information, not a commitment: see Calendar and all clear) |
| `tracker` | work items from an external system | `provider`, `query`, `account_ref`, `state_map`, `max`, `to_inbox` |
| `command` | any program printing a JSON list of items | `argv`, `max`, `to_inbox` |

Every section takes `id` (stable name, defaults to the kind; two sections of
one kind need distinct ids), `title`, `max` and `to_inbox`. Items follow the
normalized schema of [`trackers/README.md`](../trackers/README.md).

## Tracker providers

Each provider is a module under `scripts/lib/briefing_providers/`, tested
against recorded answers (`scripts/tests/fixtures/briefing/<provider>/`).
`trackers/*.md` stay as the documentation of each system.

| provider | Reaches it through | `query` keys |
|---|---|---|
| `github` | `gh search` (gh's own login) | `assignee` (default `@me`), `owners`, `repos`, `kinds` (issues, prs), `state`, `labels`, `review_requested`, `authored` (true: your own open PRs, with their age), `others_prs` (N: colleagues' open, non-draft PRs in `owners`/`repos` updated in the last N days, bots and your own left out), `limit` |
| `github-board` | `gh project item-list`, boards from `github_projects:` in the ecosystem files, state maps from `workflow/projects/` (the same code as `scripts/tracker-sync.py`). With `summary: true` on the section, also one line per board with its open cards per state, counted before `assigned_to_me` and the other filters, with the section's `state_map` applied; a status no map knows (Parked, Canceled) is not open work, and a board that filled `limit` says so | `boards`, `assigned_to_me`, `states`, `include_done`, `limit` |
| `gitlab` | `glab issue list` | `repos` (required), `assignee`, `state`, `labels`, `limit` |
| `ado` | `az boards query` (WIQL) | `wiql`, `organization`, `project`, `limit` |
| `jira` | REST API | `jql` (default: assigned to you, not done), `fields`, `limit` |
| `linear` | GraphQL API | `filter`, `team`, `limit` |

`state_map` on a section maps a raw state to a normalized one
(`{"Waiting for vendor": blocked}`) and overrides the provider's default.

### Tokens: references only

`gh`, `glab` and `az` use their own login; the profile carries no credential.
Jira and Linear need a token, and it never goes into the profile:
`account_ref` names an `identity/accounts/<id>.yaml` with the endpoint and a
`token_ref` **reference URI**, which `scripts/briefing.py` resolves through
the secrets engine at run time ([`rules/secret-placement.md`](../rules/secret-placement.md)).

```yaml
# identity/accounts/jira-example.yaml
id: jira-example
scope: user
display_name: "Jira (example)"
owner: your-handle
base_url: https://example.atlassian.net
email: you@example.com                       # Cloud basic auth
token_ref: keychain://example/jira-token     # the value lives in the keychain
# auth: bearer                               # Data Center personal access token
```

`validate` refuses a profile with a credential-named key holding a plain
value, and any value read through the engine is scrubbed from error lines.

## Views

The sections say where the data comes from. The `view:` block says how the
reader sees it, and every person picks their own:

| `style` | What the reader gets |
|---|---|
| `sources` | One block per section, in profile order. The default: a profile without `view:` looks as it always did. |
| `triage` | Every row sorted by what to do with it: **do** (you, now), **plan** (you, no date), **delegate** (the Bridge does it), **waiting** (on someone else, with how long), **drop** (park it?). A thing two sources carry (the same issue on GitHub and on a board) is one row naming both. Housekeeping comes last. |
| `brevity` | The bottom line, then the top three with why each matters, then how many more. For a phone or a busy day. |
| `plan` | Your rows laid into today's free calendar gaps, what the Bridge does meanwhile, and when the day ends. |
| `report` | Markdown that reads like a report, by exception: one **status** line naming only what failed (✗) or needs a look (⚠, a `report_ok` section with rows) and the green ones in one go (✓), the calendar (a table from two events on), the **first** rows in bold, then each bucket as a short numbered list. A bucket shows `view.report.per_bucket` rows (default 5), taken in turn from each source so one source cannot fill it, and counts the rest. Tables only where rows compare. Issue and PR ids are links; internal ids stay out. |

```yaml
view:
  style: triage            # sources | triage | brevity | plan | report
  headline: true           # one bottom line on top: yours today, free until, next hard date
  dayline: true            # the workday as one line: · free, █ busy, ▲ now (not in brevity)
  report: {top: 3, per_bucket: 5}   # style report: rows in bold first, rows per bucket
  overview: inline         # inline | file: Boards and Activity below the buckets, or in a file
  agenda: true             # Calendar block: every event from now through the lookahead, overlaps marked
  since_last: true         # "since 07:18: 2 new, 1 changed"
  lookahead_days: 1        # due within today + 1 day counts as now; deferred items coming back show
  max_items: 12            # the whole briefing, then "+N more" and an explicit end
  answer_keys: true        # numbered rows, letters per bucket: answer "1a 3b"
  hygiene: bottom          # bottom | hide
  color: auto              # colour only where it means something; none = never
  width: 100               # rows wrap at a word, never cut inside one
  labels: {end: "That's all for today."}
  buckets:                 # order, titles, answer letters; a bucket left out is hidden and counted
    - {id: do, title: "Do (you, today)", options: [yes, later, drop]}
    - {id: delegate, title: "I'll do"}
    - {id: plan}
    - {id: waiting, nudge_after_days: 7}
    - {id: drop}
  plan:                    # style plan only
    workday: {start: "08:00", end: "17:00"}
    default_minutes: 30

mutes:                     # rows the person never wants again; the briefing says how many it hid
  - {section: advise, when: {check: quiet}}
```

`render --style <style>` shows one run another way without touching the file;
`collect --json` carries the computed view under `view` for the agent. A new
profile copied from the template starts with `triage`; a profile without a
`view:` block keeps one block per section.

Two overview blocks sit below the buckets, never in them, since they say what
moved rather than what to do: **Boards** (one line per board of a `github-board`
section with `summary: true`, boards without open cards left out) and
**Activity** (the `commits` sections' sparklines). `brevity` leaves both out. With
`view.overview: file` they leave the printed text altogether: `render` writes them
to `.bridge/briefings/<id>.overview.txt` and housekeeping names the file (label
`overview_file`). Meant for a briefing an agent copies into a chat by hand, where
a long block is the part that gets copied wrong.

Small aids for reading at a glance: each bucket header says how many rows it
holds (`── Plan · 4 ──`, also when `max_items` shows fewer), the day line puts
the calendar in one row, and in a colour terminal an issue id is a link (OSC 8)
to its page. A first run (no previous snapshot) marks nothing as new, since
there is nothing to compare with.

**Which bucket a row lands in** is a fixed rule, so the shape never depends on
which agent renders it:

| Source | Bucket |
|---|---|
| inbox item, urgency `now`/`today`, or due within the lookahead | do |
| inbox item otherwise | plan |
| inbox item deferred and back within the lookahead | do if only you can or it is due within the lookahead, else plan |
| inbox item the briefing filed from a tracker row (`to_inbox`) | the same row as that tracker row, not a second one |
| task with `next: {who: bridge}` | delegate |
| task with `next: {who: me}` (or the profile's `for`) | do if `next.due` is within the lookahead, else plan |
| task with `next.who` naming anyone else | waiting, with days since `last_updated` |
| task with `blocked_by` | waiting, with days since `blocked_since` (else `last_updated`); a nudge once `nudge_after_days` passed |
| task without a next step | housekeeping: "N tasks without a next step" |
| advice `quiet` | drop (the task shows once, there) |
| advice `collision` | do · `wip`: housekeeping · `blocked`, `waiting`, `due`: carried by their row |
| tracker row in review or `category: qa` | do · `blocked`: waiting · done/removed: left out · else plan |
| a section that failed | housekeeping, with its reason |
| calendar | the headline, the Calendar block and the plan; activity: the since line; workplace: one line |
| two calendar events within the lookahead that overlap | do ("A and B overlap"), and both are marked in the Calendar block |
| an overlap with an info event (`info_calendars`) | no row: the Calendar block marks both entries "alongside …" and tags the info event |

When two sources carry the same thing, the row takes the more urgent bucket of
the two, unless a section forces its own. Only ids that name their repository
(`owner/repo#12`) are merged across sections; any other id (a command's `1`, an
ADO number) stays apart per section. A section's `max:` still caps how many rows
it contributes. A section can force its rows into one bucket (`bucket: delegate`),
which wins over the derived bucket, or keep them out of the view (`bucket: none`).
Advice that repeats a row (`blocked`, `waiting`, `due`) is folded into that row
and stands alone only when no such row is shown. Housekeeping (failed sources,
muted rows) shows in every style, `brevity` included; `plan` shows every row
somewhere (laid out, meanwhile, waiting, drop, later), so it has no "+N more". The next step of a task is a frontmatter field
in its STATUS.md: `next: {what: "Draft the request", who: bridge, due: 2026-10-07,
estimate_min: 20}` (`who`: `bridge`, `me`, or a person).

**Labels.** Every word the reader sees has a label name, so a profile can speak
the person's language: `yours_today`, `free_until`, `free_rest`, `busy_until`,
`next_date`, `since`, `today`, `tomorrow`, `due`, `back_on`, `only_you`,
`collides`, `waiting_days`, `with`, `task`, `nudge`, `new`, `housekeeping`,
`no_next`, `muted`, `hidden`, `error`, `workplace`, `more`, `end`, `why`,
`meanwhile`, `later`, `shutdown`, `activity_title`, `commits`, `boards_title`,
`st_new`, `st_ready`, `st_in_progress`, `st_review`, `st_blocked`, `agenda_title`,
`clashes`, `clash_row`, `parallel`, `info_tag`, `all_clear`, `owed`, `overview_file`, and for `report` `report_title`, `lage`, `first_title`, `bucket_more` and the table columns `col_when`, `col_what`, `col_note`, `col_board`, `col_repo`, `col_branch`, `col_days`, `col_commits`. Placeholders in braces stay as they are: a label may use only the placeholders
its default has (`validate` names them), and one that would not format falls
back to the default wording instead of breaking the briefing.

**Calendar and all clear.** "Free until 16:00" alone hides what is at 16:00, so
the Calendar block lists every event from now through `lookahead_days`, and two
events that overlap are marked there and become one do row. A section with
`report_ok: true` says `<title>: all clear` under the headline when it completed
with nothing open: a green source must read differently from one that never ran.
A failed or skipped section never claims it; its failure is housekeeping. Rows
the person muted count as nothing open. The line belongs to the views; `sources`
shows the section with its count `(0)` instead. The same event from two
calendars is listed once, and events that overlap in a chain (A with B, B with C)
are one do row naming all of them; `plan` lays events out itself and gets no
such row.

**Info calendars.** Some calendars say what others do, not what the reader
committed to: a family calendar, a shared team rota. List them on the calendar
section as `info_calendars: [Family]`. Their events stay in the Calendar block,
tagged `[info]`, and an overlap with one is marked `alongside <title>` on both
entries, but it never becomes a do row, never makes the headline say "busy",
never blocks a slot in `plan`, and never raises an advise collision. Two
ordinary events still clash as before, and an info event in the same chain is
named beside them, not in the row. `icalbuddy` asks a second time, limited to
those calendars (`-ic`); `ics` matches the file's `X-WR-CALNAME`; a `command`
marks an event `"info": true` or names its `"calendar"`. An event that is in an
info calendar and in an ordinary one counts as ordinary.

**Owed streams.** A profile covers some of the playbook's streams; the rest
are still run by the agent. `briefing.py owed [<id>]` names every stream that
applies to this Bridge (`prs`, `meetings`, `imports`, `upstream`,
`applications`, `channels`, `backups`) and that no section covers, each with how
to run it, and the view repeats the list under housekeeping (label `owed`). A
section declares what it covers with `covers: [meetings]`; a github tracker with
`others_prs` covers `prs` by itself. So the agent runs exactly the gaps, instead
of guessing which ones exist.

The upstream stream ships its own source, so it can live in the profile instead
of being run by hand:

```yaml
  - kind: command
    id: upstream
    title: "Upstreams"
    argv: ["python3", "skills/briefing/scripts/upstream_items.py"]
    covers: [upstream]
    report_ok: true
```

It fetches each CORE upstream through the remote whose URL names it and counts
the commits not merged yet, and reads org overlays through
`scripts/overlay.py status --json`. An upstream it cannot reach is a row, never
"in sync".

**Bookkeeping.** `--file` also does what the playbook once left to the agent,
because a step a run can skip is a step nobody did: it opens today's day block in
`work/log.md` when missing, writes the briefing's log row into today's block (inside its table, wherever the
block stands; a second filing run within 30 minutes replaces the row instead of
adding one),
regenerates `work/board.md` through `scripts/gen-board.py`, and names an overdue
archive (`scripts/archive-buckets.py`) under housekeeping. A step that fails is a
housekeeping line, never an abort.

**Feedback.** "Not this again" on a row becomes a `mutes:` entry matching it
(same matching as `to_inbox`). The briefing still says how many rows it hid,
so a mute never makes something disappear without a trace.

## Dashboard pages

A dashboard shows the
briefing as one page and every other section on tabs beside it. Which section
stands on which tab differs per person, so the profile says it:

```yaml
view:
  pages:
    - id: systems
      title: Systems
      sections:
        - {id: probes, alarm: true, empty: "all probes green"}
        - {id: upstream, empty: "nothing behind"}
    - id: dates
      title: Dates
      sections: [calendar, deadlines]
    - id: github
      title: GitHub
      sections:
        - github-mine
        - {id: boards, detail: [raw_state, project]}
  page_rest: show          # a section no page names goes to the tab "More"; hide leaves it out
```

`collect --json` carries the result as `pages`: every row in the same four
columns, **when** (a date, today as its time), **title**, **detail** and a
**link**. A column stays empty only when the item has nothing for it.

| Kind | when | detail | dimmed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `calendar` | start | "until HH:MM", "info" | started already |
| `tracker` | `due`, else `changed_at` | PR, state, project (when the id does not name it), priority | |
| `command` | `due` | `raw_state` or `state` (every row is a finding: yellow, `blocked` red) | |
| `commits` | today's commits | sparkline and branch, busiest first | none today |
| `activity` | `changed_at` | project | an earlier day |
| `inbox` | `due`, else `changed_at` | kind, gate (`urgency: now` yellow) | |
| `tasks` | `due`, else `changed_at` | priority, project, `blocked_by` (blocked: yellow) | |
| any other | `due`, else `changed_at` | state, project | |

A page lists every row a section found, not only the briefing's first few
(`max:`); the dashboard pages through them. A source may set a row's colour
itself with `tone: bad | warn | dim | none` on the item (a usage figure is
information, not a finding).

Each row also says where it leads. **url** is a web address, or a file of this
Bridge as a `file://` link when the item names a path that exists (a task's
`STATUS.md`, a protocol). A path outside the Bridge never becomes a link; a web
address loses any user and password, and one whose query carries a key (`code=`,
`token=`, `sig=`, …) is left out, because "ask" hands the link to the agent. `commits` link to the repository's commit list when its
`origin` is a web host; an `activity` row whose context is a task or stream links
to its `STATUS.md`. **task** names the task a row belongs to (an activity row, a
proposed tab, a task), so a dashboard can jump to its tab or open one. **ask** is
true for a finding (red or yellow) and a tracker row: worth handing to the agent.

A page entry overrides that per section: `when` and `link` name an item field,
`detail` one field or a list, `empty` the text for nothing, and `alarm: true`
makes every row a red finding and an empty section "all green"; `badge: false`
keeps a section out of the number on its tab. Each section
also says what it adds to its tab's badge (`weight`: rows not dimmed, for
`commits` today's commits; `bad`: red rows).

Without `view.pages`, the kind decides: `command` on Status, `calendar` on Dates,
`tracker` on Trackers, `commits` and `activity` on Today, any other kind on More.
The kinds the briefing page shows itself (`inbox`, `advise`, `tasks`) stay off the
tabs unless a page names them. Tab names come from the labels `page_status`,
`page_dates`, `page_trackers`, `page_today`, `page_more`; `validate` names a page
section the profile does not have.

A dashboard that pages through the result loads in two runs: a quick one
(`--skip tracker --skip command`, the kinds that wait on a service; a few
seconds) and then a full run. The full run is no slower than one with `--only`, since
sections run side by side, and it is the only run where the headline and the
advice see the inbox and the calendar together. A reload after a click runs
only the quick part and keeps every section it left out, the headline included,
from the earlier run, so a click never waits for GitHub.

A slow source can keep its answer: `cache_minutes: 5` on a section makes the
next runs answer from its last good result until five minutes have passed
(`.bridge/briefing-cache/<profile>/<section>.json`). A failure is never kept, a
section whose configuration changed asks again, and `collect --fresh` always
asks. The page section then carries `as_of`, the time its source last
answered, so a dashboard can say how old the rows are. Measured on one Bridge:
a full run of 26 s took 2.3 s with GitHub and the health probes cached. A
`github-board` row gets the date its issue or PR last changed from one GraphQL
call for all rows, since a board listing carries none.

`view.marks` puts a label in front of every row that names one of its words:

```yaml
view:
  marks:
    - {label: ACME, match: [acme, acme-portal], color: magenta}
    - {label: Beta, match: beta-corp}
```

A word matches anywhere in the row's title, id, project, repo, task, context,
area, labels or link, whatever its case; the first mark that fits wins. The
mark reaches the briefing's rows (`mark`) and the page rows alike. Customers
and projects come and go, so they belong in the profile, never in code.

### Your settings, and where they live

Everything a person tunes lives in their own files (USER tier); the code reads
it and carries no names or customers of its own.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Sections, sources, queries, `cache_minutes` per section | `workflow/briefings/<id>.yaml` `sections:` |
| Tabs and their columns (`when`, `detail`, `link`, `empty`, `alarm`, `badge`) | same profile, `view.pages`, `view.page_rest` |
| Marks in front of rows (customers, projects) | same profile, `view.marks` |
| Wording of the briefing (headline, tab names, "today") | same profile, `view.labels` |
| Name of the control workspace that polls the tabs | `bridge-config.yaml` `workplace.control.name` |

## Change marks

The time limit (`timeout_sec`, default 30 s) covers a whole section, all of
its calls together, so a slow tracker costs at most that.
A `gh` call that fails on a GitHub rate limit is tried again after 5 and then
15 seconds, as long as the wait still fits that limit: such errors come in
bursts when several sessions query at once, and clear within seconds.

Each run is compared with the previous run of the same profile on the same
machine (`.bridge/briefings/<id>.last.json`, derived, not committed). Rows
carry `new` and `changed`, so a briefing can lead with what moved since
yesterday instead of repeating the whole list. A run in which a section
failed keeps that section's last good snapshot, so a lookup that failed
today does not make every row look new tomorrow.

## Inbox rules

`to_inbox` turns rows that need a person into [inbox](inbox.md) items:

```yaml

  - when: {state: blocked}                         # every listed field must match
    urgency: now                                   # now | today (default) | later

The key is `briefing:<profile>:<section>:<item>`, so a repeat is one item,
and a dropped key stays quiet. When the row is gone, the item closes on the
next run **in which that section completed**; an errored section closes
nothing, because a failed lookup is no evidence that the row is gone (the
same rule the advice checks follow). Filing needs `--file`, which the
briefing workflow passes.

## Profiles shared by an org

A profile with `scope: org` can ship in an org overlay, so a whole team gets
the same morning shape. `assignee: "@me"` resolves on each person's machine
to their own login, so one shared GitHub section gives every colleague their
own issues and pull requests across the org, and a `github-board` section
with `assigned_to_me: true` their own cards on the team's boards. A person
who wants something else sets `briefing.default` to their own profile; the
config wins over the shared file's `default: true`.

## Writing your own source

Anything without a provider is a `command` section: a program that prints a
JSON list (or JSON lines) of items in the normalized schema, run from the
Bridge root. A source that turns out to be useful to others is a new module
under `scripts/lib/briefing_providers/` with recorded answers and tests.

## Example

[`examples/portfolio/workflow/briefings/`](../examples/portfolio/workflow/briefings/)
has a morning profile (inbox, advice, a client board whose blocked cards
become inbox items, the person's own GitHub work, calendar) and a second
profile for one client's weekly call.
