# Inbox

## Why

A finding, a question from an agent, a decision, a draft waiting for its send:
each used to live wherever it happened to be written down. A sentence in the log,
a chat message, a mail from a scheduled job, a line in a STATUS.md. Nothing
closed them. A briefing that re-read those places reported things as open that
had been solved hours earlier, because the sentence saying "needed" was still
there and the one saying "done" was further down.

The inbox is the single place for everything that needs a person. An item stays
until it is done, and "done" is decided by the live source where possible (the
PR is merged, the file exists), not by someone remembering to cross it out.

## Layout

```
work/inbox/<id>/item.yaml          written once, never changed
work/inbox/<id>/events/*.yaml      one NEW file per change
work/inbox.md                      GENERATED view (python3 scripts/inbox.py render)
```

`item.yaml` carries `schema_version`, `created`, `from`, `kind`, `summary`,
`urgency`, `gate` and optionally `task`, `due`, `detail`, `key`, `action`
(`argv` and `label`, no shell) and `closes_when`. Schema:
[`work/templates/_schema.inbox-item.yaml`](../work/templates/_schema.inbox-item.yaml),
annotated example: [`work/templates/inbox-item.yaml`](../work/templates/inbox-item.yaml).

Every change is a **new event file**, never an edit. Verbs: `seen`, `note`,
`approve`, `reject`, `drop`, `defer`, `urgency`, `close`, `executed`, `failed`. Two machines
writing the same inbox through git therefore never touch the same file, and an
item id ends in a random tail, so two machines filing the same thing in the same
minute still create two folders. This is the property the task folders already have, and
`work/board.md` is derived from them for the same reason. The inbox state is
derived from events and never stored.

Kinds: `decision`, `question`, `finding`, `draft`, `result`. Urgency: `now`,
`today`, `later`.

## States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `open` | nobody has answered |
| `approved` | a person said yes, `run` may execute the action |
| `waiting` | a conditional yes is recorded, `run` executes when the condition holds |
| `deferred` | pushed to a later day with `defer --until` |
| `done` | closed (by a person or by `check`) or executed |
| `dropped` | rejected or dropped |

`open`, `approved` and `waiting` count as active and show in `list`.

## Gates

- `free`: the Bridge may act alone. `run` executes the action without a yes. A
  failed free action waits for a person instead of retrying on every tick.
- `your-yes`: acts after a person's yes. A **conditional yes** is
  `approve --when-json '{"gh_pr": "contoso/portal#70", "state": "green"}'`
  ("merge once green"): the item is `waiting`, and `run` executes it when the
  condition holds.
- `only-you`: send, publish, pay. `run` never executes it, whatever was
  recorded, and a conditional yes on it is refused. The item exists so a person
  does the click.

## Probes (`closes_when`)

`check` evaluates each open item's `closes_when` against the live source and
closes what holds. Probes: `path_exists`, `command` (exit code, optional
`expect_exit`), `after` (a date), `gh_pr` (with `state` merged, closed, open or
green), `gh_issue` (with `state`), `task_status` (with `status`), and `all` /
`any` to combine them.

A probe that cannot be evaluated (no network, a typo, a missing task) is
**unknown, never true**. The item stays open rather than vanishing on an error.

## Every item needs a way out (`closer`)

An item without a probe stays open until somebody remembers it. `closer` says who
ends it instead: `reporter` (the job that filed it closes it by key once the
condition is gone: `inbox.py close --key <key>`), `person`, or `bot` (a watcher
that acts on it). `add` warns about a `finding` or `question` with neither
`closes_when` nor `closer`. It warns rather than refuses, because filers run
unattended and a refusal would lose the finding.

An alarm path that announces both the trouble and its end should close by key: the
all-clear carries the alarm's own title, so the receiver rebuilds the key it filed
the alarm under and closes that item rather than filing a new one.

## Who writes

- A scheduled job on an always-on machine (a watcher that finds a red check or
  a stale PR).
- An agent or a terminal tab that reached a point where it needs a person.
- The briefing's own checks, when they find something to act on.
- A peer Bridge, but only through its own front door (an A2A request that a
  local job files), never by writing into this repository.
- The session itself, at the end of a unit of work (see the standing order
  [`inbox`](../protocols/standing-orders/inbox.md)).

**The rule: a finding files an item only when somebody has to act.** Green stays
quiet. Use `--key` for anything that can fire again: a repeat of an open item
with the same key adds a `seen` event, not a second item.

## Who reads

- The briefing, first: it runs `check` and reads the inbox instead of
  re-deriving "open" from the log.
- Phone and e-ink digests, as short views: `python3 scripts/inbox.py list --short`
  prints one line per item.
- A control tab, which can show `work/inbox.md` or the JSON of `list --json`.

## CLI

```bash
python3 scripts/inbox.py add --from homebox/issue-radar --kind decision \
    --summary "PR #70 is green and waits for a merge" --task portal-relaunch \
    --action-json '{"argv": ["gh", "pr", "merge", "70", "-R", "contoso/portal"]}' \
    --closes-when-json '{"gh_pr": "contoso/portal#70", "state": "merged"}'
python3 scripts/inbox.py list [--all] [--json] [--short]   # open items, most urgent first
python3 scripts/inbox.py show <id>                         # item plus its events; an unambiguous id prefix works
python3 scripts/inbox.py approve <id> [--when-json '{...}'] [--text "edited draft"]
python3 scripts/inbox.py reject|close|drop <id> [--note "why"]
python3 scripts/inbox.py close --key <key> [--note "why"]     # every live item filed under that key
python3 scripts/inbox.py defer <id> --until 2026-10-08
python3 scripts/inbox.py urgency <id> now|today|later       # re-rank; the latest urgency event wins
python3 scripts/inbox.py note <id> "Sam will answer on Monday"
python3 scripts/inbox.py check                             # close what the live source says is done
python3 scripts/inbox.py run [--dry-run]                   # execute what a person released
python3 scripts/inbox.py render                            # regenerate work/inbox.md
python3 scripts/inbox.py validate                          # structure of items and events
python3 scripts/inbox.py sync [--no-push]
```

`--by` (or `$BRIDGE_ACTOR`, default the host name) sets who an event is
attributed to. `add` takes `--due`, `--detail`, `--key`, `--urgency` (default
`today`) and `--gate` (default `your-yes`). Items are `from` a machine and job
(`homebox/issue-radar`), not a person.

## Two machines, one inbox

`inbox.py sync` stages and commits **only** `work/inbox/`, rebases onto the
upstream and pushes. Nothing else in the working tree is committed, and the push
is refused when the branch carries unpushed commits outside `work/inbox/`: syncing
the inbox never ships unfinished work along with it. Because each change is its
own new file, the rebase has nothing to merge; if it still fails it is aborted
and the commit stays local for the next sync. The generated `work/inbox.md` is
not part of a sync: every render rewrites its time stamp, so two machines
committing it would conflict every time. Commit it like `work/board.md`, from
the one machine you work on, or not at all.

**Exactly one runner.** `run` executes on every machine that calls it, and two
machines would both see an approved item before the other's `executed` event
arrived. Name the one that acts in `bridge-config.yaml`:

```yaml
inbox:
  runner: homebox      # the actor (--by / $BRIDGE_ACTOR / host name) that executes actions
```

Everywhere else `run` prints "not running" and does nothing. Without the key
every machine runs, which is right for a Bridge on one machine only.

**Trust.** An item can carry a command (`action.argv`, a `command` probe). Anyone
who can push into `work/inbox/` can therefore make the runner execute something,
exactly as anyone who can push a script the runner calls already can: the inbox
is as trusted as the repository, and no more. Peer Bridges never write here.
`list`, `show` and `work/inbox.md` always print the command a yes would run, and
an `only-you` item executes nothing at all, not even a `command` probe.

**Time.** Events are stamped in UTC with an offset and ordered by that, so a
laptop in one time zone and an always-on machine in another agree on what came
first.

## Relation to the approval runtime

[`agents/_runtime/approval.py`](../agents/_runtime/approval.py) holds an agent's
outbound answer until a person approves it. An approver command can file the
held answer as an inbox item (kind `draft`, gate `only-you`) so it shows up where
everything else waits, and the person's `approve --text` releases an edited
version. That bridge is the script `scripts/inbox-approve.py`, written separately
from this model.
