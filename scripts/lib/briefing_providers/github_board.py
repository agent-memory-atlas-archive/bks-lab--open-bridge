"""GitHub Projects (V2) boards, through the same code as scripts/tracker-sync.py.

Boards come from `github_projects:` in the ecosystem files, state maps from
workflow/projects/<slug>.yaml: the registry tracker-sync already reads, so a
board is configured once. Done and removed cards are left out unless asked.

query keys (all optional):
  boards          [slug, ...]  only these boards (default: every registered board)
  assigned_to_me  true: only cards assigned to you (bridge-config
                  integrations.github.assignee_me, else your gh login)
  states          [normalized state, ...]  only these
  include_done    true: keep done/removed cards
  limit           per board, default 200
