"""Contract for scripts/upstream-autoupdate.sh + scripts/upstream-resolve.py.

The defect these pin: the daily auto-update stopped at the first predicted
conflict, and since nothing ever resolved one, it stopped every morning after.
An instance sat 84 commits behind with 10 conflicting files, 3 of which were
fixes it had promoted itself and upstream had merely followed up on. A dirty
work/log.md, dirty for most of every working day, stopped it as well.

What a machine may decide, and what it must not:
  · promoted, then built on upstream  → take upstream, merge
  · promoted, then REVERTED upstream  → hold (the change may be live locally)
  · never promoted                    → hold
  · one held file holds the whole run, and the branch is left exactly as it was
  · a dirty file the merge does not touch is no reason to stop; one it touches is

Every case runs the real script against throwaway repositories.
