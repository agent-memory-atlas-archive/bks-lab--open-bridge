# upstream-autoupdate.sh — GUARDED daily auto-merge of upstream CORE updates.
#
# Auto-merges the upstream ref into the current user/* branch ONLY when it is
# provably safe. Otherwise it does NOT merge — it writes a status report and
# (optionally) notifies. Every guard FAILS CLOSED: any error or unknown state
# skips the merge rather than risking a bad one.
#
# Authoritative safety gate = `git merge-tree` (content-based conflict
# prediction). The name-based divergence sentinel is used only for the
# informational report, never as the merge decision (it can flag files that are
# byte-identical after a prior contribution).
#
# Guards (ALL must pass):
#   1. on a user/* branch
#   2. nothing staged, and no uncommitted TRACKED change in a file the merge
#      touches. A dirty file the merge does not touch is no reason to skip:
#      work/log.md is dirty for most of every working day, and treating that as
#      a stop kept the job from ever running on the days it was needed.
#   3. git merge-tree predicts 0 conflicts (read from its EXIT CODE — never
#      from its localized output; see the note at the guard itself) — OR every
#      predicted conflict is one scripts/upstream-resolve.py proves a machine
#      may take upstream's side of: the local version of the file is one
#      upstream itself already had, and upstream has not reverted anything
#      since. Any other conflict still stops the job, file by file, with the
#      reason and the local commits behind it.
#
# Before the resolver, ONE conflict froze this job for good: nothing ever
# resolved it, so every later morning skipped again. Measured 2026-10-01: 84
# commits behind, 10 conflicting files, 3 of them promoted fixes upstream had
# merely followed up on.
#
# After a successful merge it also FAST-FORWARDS the mirror's core branch, so the
# private origin keeps a copy of the CORE history this job just merged. Without
# that step the mirror falls behind by exactly the commits this job consumes, and
# the next `git push user/<name>` has to carry all of them: measured 1317 objects
# against a 24-day-stale mirror, 83 once it was current. The count also makes the
# user branch LOOK enormous — 161 commits ahead, of which 6 were the user's — and
# that reading has cost real debugging time twice.
#
# Env (optional): UPSTREAM_REMOTE (default upstream) · UPSTREAM_REF (default
# upstream/main) · MIRROR_REMOTE (default origin) · MIRROR_CORE=0 disables the
# mirror step · SIGNAL_ACCOUNT + SIGNAL_RECIPIENT (both set → Signal push).

# ACTIVE (no core.hooksPath override), so scripts/hooks/pre-push classifies the
# target with the one classifier there is — config push_guard.*, then the
# .bridge-origin marker — and refuses a target it cannot vouch for. Re-deriving
# that judgement here would be a copy that drifts.
#
# Three conditions, all conservative:
#   · the mirror remote exists
#   · the core branch ALREADY exists there — this step keeps an existing mirror
#     current, it never creates a branch on somebody's remote
#   · the update is a true fast-forward, checked before pushing, so no mirror
#     history is ever rewritten
# It pushes $UPSTREAM_REF, never HEAD and never the user branch, so only CORE
# commits travel; USER content is not in the pushed ref by construction.
