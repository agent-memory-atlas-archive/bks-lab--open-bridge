# Briefing as the control room: inbox first, one thing first, every line a lever

The rest of `workflow.md` gathers. This file decides what the person sees first and
what they can do from it. It runs in two places: **Phase 0.5** (before the streams)
and **Phase 4** (the top of the output). Model of the inbox: `docs/inbox.md`.
Workplace: `docs/workplace.md`. The always-on machine: `docs/always-on-machine.md`.

## The rule this file exists for

**Nothing is reported as open from the log.** A log row saying "needed" is history;
whether it is still needed is a question for the live source. A briefing that read
the log reported three things as open that had been solved hours earlier. Open is
what the inbox says after `check`, plus what a tracker or calendar says live.

## Phase 0.5: settle the inbox (always, also with `--quick`)

```bash
python3 scripts/inbox.py check            # close what the live source says is done
python3 scripts/inbox.py run --dry-run    # what a person already released and is ready
python3 scripts/inbox.py run              # execute it (free, a yes, or a yes whose condition holds)
```

`run` never executes an `only-you` item (send, publish, pay), whatever was recorded,
and never anything nobody released. Report every `ran` and every `failed` line
in the output; a `failed` item is back to open and belongs on top. When
`inbox.runner` names another machine, `run` says "not running" and the briefing
shows the `--dry-run` list as "ready, waiting for <runner>" instead.
No `work/inbox/` yet: skip silently; the first item creates it.

## After the streams: advise

Once Stream C has today's and tomorrow's calendar, write it as a JSON list of
`{"title", "start", "end"}` to a temp file and run:

```bash
python3 skills/briefing/scripts/advise.py --file --calendar-json "$TMP/calendar.json"
python3 skills/briefing/scripts/advise.py --json --calendar-json "$TMP/calendar.json"
```

`--file` turns collisions, quiet tasks, long blocks and WIP over the cap into inbox
items under stable keys (a repeat stays one item; a finding that is gone closes its
own item). The `--json` run adds the report-only lines (`waiting`, `due`). Without a
calendar the collision check is skipped, everything else runs. Thresholds:
`briefing.advise` in bridge-config.yaml.

Then `python3 scripts/inbox.py list --json` is the source for the top of the output.

## Phase 4 with a view: the script's shape is the output, not the whole briefing

When the profile has `view.style` other than `sources` (or the person asked for
`--style`), run `python3 scripts/briefing.py render [<id>] --file`. The buckets,
the order, the numbering, the Calendar block and the housekeeping are computed
there (docs/briefings.md § Views). `--file` already opened today's day block,
wrote the briefing's log row and regenerated the board; do not do those again.

**Show the rendered text verbatim**, in a code block at the top of your answer.
The person does not see tool output: a table that summarises the view, or "see
above", is a briefing they never got. Do not regroup, re-sort, shorten or drop
rows.

**Then the owed streams, and only those.** The view covers what the profile's
sections cover. `python3 scripts/briefing.py owed [<id>]` names every stream
that applies to this Bridge and that no section covers, each with the way to run
it; housekeeping repeats the list. Run exactly those, the way `owed` says, and
nothing else: a stream it does not name is covered or does not apply, and running
it again by hand (a second PR search, your own config queries) only adds
improvised commands that can fail. What an owed stream finds goes below the view
as rows in the same bucket words, numbered on from the view's last number.

**Never a second row for something the view shows.** A detail that sharpens a
row (the disk is at 99 %, not just over 90 %) is a note on that row by its
number ("zu 3: ..."), not a new row. Green stays one sentence ("Backups: all
clear"). The morning of 2026-10-06 showed why both rules exist: first the view
looked complete and the streams were skipped, then a test run listed the same
disk twice and redid a PR search the profile already ran.

**A finding about a run is yours to check, not the person's.** "Look at the
first run of X" is never a row for the person: read the run's log or trace,
then report the result in one sentence, and only a deviation becomes a row.
Filing such a check needs a `closes_when`, or it is not filed.

**Close with the receipt**, one line: `Steps: inbox ✓ · view ✓ · <owed stream>
✓/skipped (why) · ...`, listing exactly the streams `owed` named. A stream the
profile covers is not listed. A stream that runs by hand every morning belongs
in the profile: propose a `command` section with `covers:` and `report_ok: true`
after the second time.

Two things are yours besides:

- **Why the first row is first**, in one sentence under the headline, when the
  derived reason (due, back on, waiting N days) does not already say it.
- **The answers.** "1a 3b" picks the letter of that row's bucket. Default
  letters: do `a yes · b later · c drop` (inbox approve, defer, drop),
  delegate `a go · b not now` (start it, or leave it), waiting `a nudge · b wait`
  (a nudge is a DRAFT for the person, never sent), drop `a park · b keep`
  (park = `status: backlog`). A profile may rename the options; their order
  keeps these meanings.

A stream that runs every morning belongs in the profile, not in this list: a
`command` section with `report_ok: true` turns it into rows and an all-clear
line the engine computes. Propose that when the same stream is added by hand on
two runs.

"Not this again" on a row is a `mutes:` entry in the profile matching that row
(`{section: <id>, when: {...}}`): propose the entry, write it on a yes, run
`briefing.py validate`. A task under housekeeping without a next step gets one
proposed (`next: {what, who, due}` in its STATUS.md), not guessed into a bucket.

## Phase 4: the top of the output

Without a view (`style: sources`, the default), render these three sections
ABOVE everything else in `workflow.md` § Phase 4.

```
── One thing first ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  {summary}
  {why it is first: urgency, due, collision, what waits on it}
  → {proposed action}            [{gate}]   {a} yes · {b} later · {c} drop

── Waiting for you ({N}) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────

  1. {urgency} {kind}  {summary}  [{task}]  → {action or "decide"}  [{gate}]
  2. ...
  Ran since last briefing: {items closed by `check` or executed by `run`}

── Workplace today ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  {output of: python3 scripts/workplace.py propose}
  [a] open all · [b] only <workspaces> · [c] nothing
```

**One thing first** is the first item of `inbox.py list` (ordered by urgency, then
decisions before findings, then due), unless an advise finding of urgency `now`
exists. Say WHY it is first in one line. If nothing is open: "Nothing waits for
you", and the section shows the most active task instead.

**Waiting for you** lists the rest, at most 7 lines; more collapse to a count. Group
by task when three or more share one. Never list an item twice because a tracker
also shows it: the inbox line wins and the tracker section drops its duplicate.

**Workplace today** appears only when bridge-config.yaml has a `workplace:` block.
Opening needs the person's answer: show the dry run (`workplace.py open`), then
`workplace.py open --yes` or `--only A,B --yes`. The driver decides how tabs open;
with driver `none` the person gets the commands to start themselves.

## Every line is a lever

| Gate | Meaning | What the briefing may do |
|---|---|---|
| `free` | the Bridge may act alone | do it now and report it (regenerate, read, close a stale advise item) |
| `your-yes` | acts after a yes | ask; on yes run it, on "yes once X" record a conditional yes |
| `only-you` | send, publish, pay | prepare (draft, branch), never execute; say "you press send" |

Answers map onto the inbox, never onto memory or a log sentence:

| The person says | Do |
|---|---|
| yes / do it / `a` | `inbox.py approve <id>` then `inbox.py run` |
| yes once {condition} | `inbox.py approve <id> --when-json '<probe>'` (only `your-yes`; `run` executes it later) |
| later / tomorrow / `b` | `inbox.py defer <id> --until <date>` |
| drop it / `c` | `inbox.py drop <id> --note "<why>"` |
| done already | `inbox.py close <id> --note "<how>"` and, if the probe missed it, fix the probe |
| status | `workplace.py status` plus the open count per task from the inbox |
| tell {tab}: {text} | `workplace.py send <tab> <text>`; show what goes where first unless the person named both |

A condition is a probe (`docs/inbox.md` § Probes): "once it is green" on a PR is
`{"gh_pr": "owner/repo#N", "state": "green"}`.

## Offer the arm

When an item or task waits on something outside (a blocked task, a PR waiting
for checks, a reply that has not come, a service that should come back), and
a file in `infra/remotes/` lists `arm` under `capabilities` (a machine that is
always on and keeps a Bridge clone, `docs/always-on-machine.md`), offer once per item:

```
  Should {machine} watch this and file an item when it moves?   [your-yes]
```

On yes, declare the watcher through the `workload` skill with `reports_to: inbox`
and a `closes_when` matching the item. Without such a machine, say nothing: the
offer only appears where it can be kept.

## Write back

Whatever stays open at the end of the briefing is an item, not a sentence: a
promise made in a meeting, a "check tomorrow", a reply owed. File it with
`inbox.py add` and a `closes_when` wherever the live source can tell. Then
`inbox.py render` regenerates `work/inbox.md` next to `work/board.md`.
