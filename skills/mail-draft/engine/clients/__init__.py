"""Hand a built draft to a mail client. Every client creates a draft; none sends.

The contract every client keeps, each clause paid for by a mail that went wrong:

- The body travels as a FILE the AppleScript reads as UTF-8, never as an argv
  element. A long HTML body in argv made Outlook create nothing at all while
  the script reported success.
- Counts come back from the SAME tell block that created the message.
  Asking a draft afterwards is unreliable (attachments read as 0).
- Every property is read into a variable before it is concatenated; reading
  one inside an `&` expression fails with -1700.
- A draft is a draft only when the Drafts folder counts it from a fresh
  process. `verify()` does that and the result is reported, not assumed.
- Nothing calls `send`. There is no code path to it in this package.
